# 360 Business Magician: Free-Tier Implementation Plan

This document outlines the specific implementation steps to adapt our current codebase to leverage the free-tier services from GCP and Vercel. This approach will significantly reduce operational costs while maintaining all required functionality.

## Current Architecture Assessment

Our current architecture consists of:
- Memory-optimized Node.js API server
- Notion integration for data storage

2. **Setup Vercel Project**
   - Create Vercel account (if not existing)
   - Link repository to Vercel project
   - Configure build settings and environment variables
   - Set up deployment hooks

3. **Create Edge Functions for Critical Features**
   - Convert authentication/authorization logic to edge functions

   - Optimize API request handling

4. **Deployment Verification**
   - Test static asset delivery and performance
   - Verify CSP and security headers
   - Test responsive design across devices

## Phase 2: API Server Migration to Cloud Run (3-5 days)

### Tasks:
1. **Containerize API Server**

   - Configure memory limits and performance optimizations

```Dockerfile
# Example Dockerfile for optimized API server
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY . .

FROM node:20-alpine AS runner
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=builder /app/api-server-notion.js ./
COPY --from=builder /app/client/dist ./client/dist

const firestore = new Firestore();
const businessIdeasCollection = firestore.collection('business-ideas');

export async function saveBusinessIdea(idea) {
  try {
    const docRef = await businessIdeasCollection.add({
      name: idea.name,
      description: idea.description,
      viabilityScore: idea.viabilityScore,
      implementationComplexity: idea.implementationComplexity,
      interests: idea.interests,
      createdAt: Firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
      updatedAt: Firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp()
    });
    
    return { id: docRef.id, ...idea };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error saving to Firestore:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}

export async function getBusinessIdeas(userId) {
  try {
    const snapshot = await businessIdeasCollection
      .where('userId', '==', userId)
      .orderBy('createdAt', 'desc')
      .limit(50)
      .get();
      
    return snapshot.docs.map(doc => ({
      id: doc.id,
      ...doc.data()
    }));
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error retrieving from Firestore:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```
