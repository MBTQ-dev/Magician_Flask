Replit, a software creation platform, uses Claude on Google Cloud's Vertex AI to help anyone build and deploy software applications without coding experience—transforming ideas into working products in minutes.

With Claude on Vertex AI, Replit:

Supports 100k+ of applications on Google Cloud Run
Powers development on any device, from phones to laptops
Enables users to go from idea to deployed application in minutes
Provides a unified experience from development to deployment
Breaking down barriers to software creation
Replit is democratizing coding by making it faster and easier to build software. Amjad Masad, CEO and co-founder at Replit, said, "Our mission is to empower the next billion software creators. We say software creators because we don't think it's just going to be developers. Anyone should be able to create software."

Replit recognized that programming itself remained the key barrier, even though their platform had already simplified the development environment setup. “The time and resources it takes to learn how to code remains a significant barrier to growth, even with recent AI advancements,” said Masad. Citizen developers needed a solution that could automate complex technical tasks while maintaining professional-grade output.

For Replit, the mission extends beyond growing their user base. It's about democratizing access to the digital economy. "The internet is perhaps the biggest wealth generation technology ever created," said Masad. "If you make programming easier, you'll create more entrepreneurs globally. People with ideas and grit can change their lives in a fundamental way."

Why Replit chose Claude on Google Cloud's Vertex AI
After evaluating multiple AI models, Replit selected Claude on Google Cloud's Vertex AI for its superior code generation capabilities and seamless cloud integration. "The vast majority of what the agent does is code-based, and Claude is by far the best model available," said Michele Catasta, Replit's President.

Claude on Vertex AI demonstrated unique strengths in code generation and editing that set it apart from other models. Catasta said, “It creates a set of interconnected files that form a working application.” The platform proved particularly adept at handling complex tasks like editing multiple files simultaneously while maintaining context across the entire codebase.

Running Claude on Google Cloud's Vertex AI provided the enterprise-grade security and scalability Replit needed for their global user base. Catasta said, "We pioneered affordable, single-user AI agent subscriptions. Customers could simply go to our website, put in their credit card, and pay $25 to get access to the agent. We scaled quickly right from launch day."

Replit, as a major Claude customer on Vertex AI globally, benefits from seamless integration with their existing Google Cloud infrastructure, including Cloud Run, Cloud SQL, and BigQuery. This enables rapid deployment and scaling of user applications. The team values their early access to new Claude capabilities through Vertex AI, which helps plan their development roadmap and quickly implement new features.

How Claude transforms software development
Replit's AI agent leverages Claude's and Google Cloud’s capabilities to:

Automatically set up complete development environments
Provision databases and infrastructure without user intervention
Generate working applications from natural language descriptions
Show users a progress screen that displays its thought process
Enable seamless deployment to Google Cloud Run
The platform maintains enterprise-grade performance while supporting development from any device. Jeff Burke, Business Development Lead from Replit said, "You can go from using Claude to making an app in minutes and deploying to Google Cloud Run all with the same account. You're not setting up multiple vendors."

Making software creation accessible to everyone
Replit's platform, powered by Claude on Google Cloud's Vertex AI, has revolutionized software development by making it accessible to anyone with a connected device—no coding experience required. Burke said, "You can go from idea to a deployed application in minutes without any coding experience. You just need your Replit account. What's truly revolutionary is that our platform works on any device—you can build and deploy production-ready applications from anywhere."

This accessibility has enabled remarkable transformations. One user in India created applications entirely from their phone, earned enough to buy their first laptop, and now builds enterprise solutions. The platform supports users from individuals building personal applications like Chore Hero—a family task-tracking dashboard—to enterprise teams at companies like Zillow deploying production software.

The impact extends beyond traditional software developers. Masad said, "Professionals across sales, operations, and marketing are adopting Replit. Software development is becoming essential for all roles, as off-the-shelf SaaS solutions often can't meet specific business needs." This vision is already becoming reality, with tens of thousands of applications deployed on Google Cloud Run, ranging from personal projects to enterprise solutions.

Leading the future of personal software
Replit is pioneering a fundamental shift in software creation, akin to how personal computers democratized computing itself. Through their strategic collaborations with Anthropic and Google Cloud, they envision a future where AI agents leverage the full suite of cloud services to craft perfect technology stacks for any user's needs. "Think of the agent as a powerful entity that leverages Google Cloud to create the ideal technology stack for each user," explains Masad.

This vision extends beyond traditional software development. It includes individuals creating personal health tracking apps and businesses building custom enterprise solutions. Replit is positioned to continue pushing boundaries as early adopters of Anthropic's latest capabilities like computer use and with access to Google Cloud's comprehensive infrastructure. This vision is now supercharged by AI to make software creation truly accessible to anyone. Replit's mission to empower the next billion software creators isn't just aspirational—it's becoming reality as they redefine what's possible when innovative AI meets cloud infrastructure at scale.
